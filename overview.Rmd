# Challenge

TEMPLATE : a (short) description of the challenge.

# Important Dates

A summary of the dates related to the challenge phases can be found in the tab `Phases`.

# Get started

1. Create an acount on the codalab platform.

2. Go on the challenge page, in the tab `Participate` and register to get access to the challenge.

3. After approval, if required, constitute teams and design a team coordinator on the platform.

4. Read the overview of the challenge in the tab `Learn the Details`, in the menu `Overview`.

5. Download the starting kit and the public data sets in the tab `Participate`, in the item `Files`.

6. On your local machine, unzip the just downloaded zip files `stating_kit.zip` and `data_public.zip`. Copy the data sets into the unziped `starting_kit` directory.
The unziped `starting_kit` directory now contains :
- A `starting_kit.html` corresponding to the vignette of the Challenge (all useful information can be found here).
- A `submission_script.Rmd` to modify and to use to submit your predictions.
- The public data sets.

7. Then open R in the `starting_kit` directory, (e.g. open `submission_script.Rmd` with RStudio), and launch the following command to generate the baseline submission as a zip file :
```
rmarkdown::render(input = "submission_script.Rmd")
```

8. Submit your results (generated by the script `submission_script.Rmd`) in the tab `Participate`, in the item `Submit / View Results`.

9. Check the leaderboard in the tab `Results`.

**Please use the `submission_script.Rmd` contained in the `starting_kit` folder as a template to write, run and submit your code.**
