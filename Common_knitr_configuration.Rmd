Global parameters for knitr
-->


```{r include = FALSE}
##  . message = TRUE : includes messages that are generated by code in the finished file.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = TRUE)
##  . warning = TRUE : includes warnings that are generated by code in the finished file.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = TRUE)
## . comment = '##' : a character string. Knitr will append the string to the start of each line of results in the final document.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "")
##  . cache = TRUE : enable the use of cache for the code chunks.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache          = TRUE)
##  . cache.path = "cache/" : directory to save cached results in
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.path     = paste("cache", .Platform$file.sep, sep = "") )
##  . cache.lazy = FASLE : the function "load" is used instead of "lazyLoad" which may not work for very large objects.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.lazy     = FALSE)
##  . cache.comments = FALSE : changing comments in R code chunks will not invalidate the cache database
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.comments = FALSE)
```
