To create a Codalab competition, you have to generate a zip file with the required files inside and upload the archive on the Codalab platform. The *R* script `Bundle_generator_-_cmd.Rmd` allows you to automatically create a valid bundle by using the *R* terminal to ask you some questions in order to personalize the competition.

In a *R* terminal, run the following command :
`rmarkdown::render(input = "Bundle_generator_-_cmd.Rmd", envir = new.env( ) )`

You can also generate a toy bundle, with the parameters by default, with *Rscript* :
`Rsript -e 'rmarkdown::render(input = "Bundle_generator_-_cmd.Rmd", envir = new.env( ) )'`
